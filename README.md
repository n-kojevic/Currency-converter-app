# Currency Converter — Vue.js Practice Project

This is a simple **Currency Converter** web application built using **Vue.js**.  
The goal of the project was to practice the basics of the Vue framework and gain hands-on experience with its core concepts such as:

- Data binding (`v-model`)
- Event handling (`@click`, `@submit`)
- Conditional rendering (`v-if`)
- Loops (`v-for`)
- Methods and lifecycle hooks (`mounted`)
- Working with APIs
- Basic state management (within `data`)
- Dynamic image rendering based on values (flags)

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created **strictly for learning purposes**, as part of my journey into Vue.js.  
It's not meant to be a production-grade app, but a practical exercise that helped reinforce my understanding of:

- How to structure a Vue component
- How to fetch data from external APIs
- How to build interactive forms
- How to handle user input and display dynamic results

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js (CDN version)** — for reactive UI
- **ExchangeRate API** — to fetch real-time currency exchange rates
- **FlagCDN** — for rendering country flags
- **HTML5 & CSS3** — for structure and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — for application logic

---
